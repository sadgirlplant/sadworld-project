# SADWORLD Token Whitepaper

## 1. Introduction

**SADWORLD (SAD)** is a community-driven token born out of deep isolation and a desire to connect with others who share similar sentiments about the world. As the world faces the harsh realities of life, SADWORLD aims to provide a sense of hope and unity for individuals who feel disconnected from society. This token was created to help people financially while fostering a community that seeks solace from a "sad world" and escape its rigid constraints.

**Mission & Vision:**  
SADWORLD strives to bring people together, empowering them financially and offering a way to escape the confines of a world that seems to be falling apart. This project is here for those who want to better their personal lives financially, while embracing the realism of life and the comfort of shared community experiences.
